# Day 5

## What I Built
Polished task reordering so it only appears in the All view and is disabled while editing.

## What I Learned
- Avoid duplicating UI by appending elements only once
- UI state (editing) can affect what actions should be available
- Small guardrails reduce edge-case bugs and make apps feel more professional
